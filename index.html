<pre style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size: 20px;text-indent: 1cm;text-align: left;;">OMG, I CAN’T BELIEVE I FOUND IT!!! Oh hi there!
     My name is Charlotte and the excitement that you just heard is the excitement about finding a 4-leaf clover!
     CAN’T YOU BELIEVE IT??? I AM SO LUCKY!! Ok I knocked on the wood near me. I'm so sorry. I just can’t control 
     it. I am so excited for the day. You know why? Because I am hanging out with my friend, it’s spring break, 
     I have to go to my relaxing dance class..Eeeeeeeeeeeee!!! Ok. Calm down. Whew. Let’s begin. I skipped and 
     hopped through the field of mine while going back inside.
	“Hi Mom!”
	“Hi honey. It’s time for breakfast.”
	“Ok.”
    I plopped on my chair, waiting impatiently for my breakfast to arrive...YAY!!! IT’S SCRAMBLED EGGS!!! I began 
    eating while the others were doing their jobs. I finished my breakfast and went to my room for arranging. 
    (My friend is coming to my house to hang out. So…) My friend’s name is Christina. She says that she is coming
     at 7:00 P.M. today. It’s just that I have to wait for…um…6 hours. That took forever. Anyways, I have 6 hours
    of organizing everything before she comes. I got my stuff ready. OH, I TOTALLY FORGOT!! MY DANCE CLASS!!! Oh
     phew, it’s just 1:20 P.M. 
	“Honey! Get ready for your dance class!”
	Right on time!
	“Ok mom! I will!”
	I started to get dressed for dance class and checked the time. It’s 1:29. I’ll go out in just a minute…Never 
    mind. I’ll go now.



    Phew! That was a lot of energy taken from my body! I am sweating so badly! 
	“How was your dance class honey?”
	“It was awesome!”
	“Anything exciting?”
	“Yep! We got donuts after we got done with our dance practice for the fact that we did better than usual!!”
	“That is really nice!”
	“I know right? And then we got to talk to our friends for a little while!”
	“Wait..what?”
	“Oh yeah..I forgot..We had a substitute…A fun substitute!”
	“Lucky you,” said Mom, “Today must have been your best day ever, am I right?”
	“Mhm!”
	I went back to my room upstairs and plopped down on my bed. Oh. I need to do my homework from my math and 
    english class. While I was doing it, I thought about what Mom said earlier.
	Lucky you!
	My 4-leaf clover! I forgot to tell her about it! I went down the stairs to the living room.
	“Mom!”
	“Yes, honey?”
	“I totally forgot to tell you that I found a 4-leaf clover! What do you think I will get?”
	“I don’t know. I think we’ll find out!”
	“Woohoo!”
	 I skipped across the living room and returned to my homework stuff. It was somehow super easy, so I 
     completed it in less than 15 minutes. I then put my stuff away and bring them down for the next school
      day: The Monday after Spring Break. I checked the time. Ugh..4:30. Great. Now I have to wait for 2 hours
       and 30 minutes for her to come over. Oh well. 
	I went to my room and sat on my chair at my desk so that I could do some drawings. I then looked at the 
    portrait of my family, and thought about the future and what would happen next.
~
Ugh..how boring it was for the first few hours! I was doing the same thing repeatedly:
	<i>Sketch.
	Check time.
	Sketch.
	Check time.
	Sketch.
	Check time.</i>
	The last time I checked the time, my clock said 6:45. I finally got up and stretched and went downstairs
     to find out that my mom was talking to my friend’s mom about hanging out. The speaker was on. No wonder 
     I could hear the conversation.
	“So, Catherine,” my Mom started, “are you going to come late because of something?”
	“No,” Christina’s mom replied, “it’s just that we are stuck in traffic. And I have to go to my husband’s 
    interview for his job. Sorry about it.”
	Great. Now I have to wait some more time. But for a better reason.
	“Oh! Congratulations to him! You’re fine. I was just curious.”
	“Ok. See ya!”
	And then she cut the call. I went down there to talk to Mom about it. 
~
	One more minute. Christina arrives at the exact time she says. The doorbell the minute it turns 7:00. 
    I have no idea how she does it, but I’ll just go with it. 
	I went and answered the door to see only Christina there. Oh, her parents are in an interview. I thought.
     I started to have fun with her for a while.
	“My parents are in my dad’s new job interview, but I don’t like interviews, so I planned to come here. 
    My time to come here is anyways at 7:00.”
	“Cool! I already knew about the interview part.” I replied, “If he gets his job, then tell him that 
    I said congratulations if I won’t be able to see him.”
	“Ok sure!”
	We continued our fun for about an hour or so until…
	“Hey Charlotte?”
	I looked at her. “Yeah?”
	“I think I gotta go. My parents said that my dad’s interview ends at 8:30 and it's 8:20 right now.”
	“Oh yeah sure. You’re fine. Bye!”
	“¡Buenas noches!”
	Oh..I forgot that she is Spanish. I waved her goodbye as she walked down the street to go to her 
    parent’s interview building.
	I got so hungry that I am starving. I went towards Mom.
	“Mom,” I started, “When is food ready?”
	“In a few minutes.”
	“Ok.”
	I switched on my TV to watch some of my favorite TV shows. Best day of my life! I thought. I wished 
    it was always like this!</pre>

    
    <h2 style="text-align: center;"> Chapter Two </h2>
    <pre style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size: 20px;text-indent: 1cm;text-align: left;;"> 
        I switched off my movie and got up to stretch. Boy! How creepy that was! I literally hugged my mom during those parts!
         Oh well, it’s time to go to bed. I brushed my teeth and plopped on my bed upside down. Splat! 
         What was that sound? I looked under my bed and under me to find out. Oh my god! It was just my 
         imagination! I take things too seriously. I flipped over, turned on my night lamp. In 7 minutes,
          blackness. 
        I always wondered why there were always these rippling effects that are in neon colors when you 
        close your eyes, but before I could complete the thought, Something happened…
        
    <i>I’m in a dream. A nightmare dream.
        I am in total darkness and I am running away from the lord of darkness. </i>
        
    “You can’t run. You can’t hide. So, what will you do now, huh?”

        My heart pounded ‘till the time where it felt like my heart was a big, fat stone. 

        “Mua Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaaaaaaaaaaa!!!”
    I woke up that instant, because the dream was way too scary for me to carry on.  
        I jumped off my bed. It’s 5:00 A.M. I exit the room to spot my mom in her room staring at the 
        mirror. I entered her room.

        “What happened Mom?”
        “Nothing. Why are you still awake?”
        “Because I couldn’t sleep and why are you just staring at your mirror?”
        Mom sighed. “I dreamed of some sort of lord of the dark.”
        I gasped. “I had that dream too!” 

        Mom stared at me really worriedly. 
        
        “Something tells me that something isn’t right,” Mom explained.
        We paused and stared at each other for a long moment until mom interrupted.
    “Let’s just go back to bed and discuss this tomorrow,” and we both headed for our beds.
    ~
        We woke up the next morning to a calm and peaceful, sunny day. We went on as usual for our morning
         routine. Then, something struck me…what really happened this morning!? I went to Mom and asked her
          when to talk about the dream incident. 
        “Oh! The dream! History states that when 2 people have the same dream, then the event has a 90% chance
         of coming true, but when there’s a nightmare, then the dream will 100% come true, but that is only our 
         belief. We don’t really know if it could actually come true.” 
        “I’m scared, Mom!” I said.
    “Don’t be worried, it only states that in the History book, although it never happened to me ever once before,”
     Mom assured me. I knew that she was hiding something from me. Like some type of event that it really could have 
     happened at least once in her life. I tried to hide the fact that I was curious about what she was hiding. Someone
      interrupted my thoughts at that exact moment.

    “Honey! Where is my towel?” Dad yelled from his room about 3 times in a row. I forgot to tell you, I also have a dad!
    “Coming!” Mom said annoyingly. “Will you ever just SHUT UP!!!??? We are talking about something IMPORTANT here. ”
    “Sorry, but please hurry,” he continued, “I need to get ready for my job!!!”
    “Oh fine,” Mom said.
    She stomped her way up the stairs and when she arrived, they both began a fuss about interrupting. As usual. 
    I went to my room and laid down for the comfort that I would feel if I had any stress or tension about something. Much
     better, I thought. Hey, when would my friend be available to talk? I might as well try calling her once. I picked up my 
     phone and texted:
        <i>Hi
        Wassup?
        R u available? 										
        Wanna talk?	</i>	
    No reply. It says that she’s online..WHAT IS GOING ON???!!! Oh finally..hehe..she replied:				
       <i> Hi
        Yes, I am available
        Isn’t it kind of obvious that you want to talk?</i>

    Ugh, I hate her for showing off how good she is with her grammar and spelling without messing up. At least be like a normal 
    casual friend? Anyways, I called her on video chat and she picked up. We basically chatted about the casual life difficulties 
    and hardships and how excited we were for spring break.

        “Oh..Christina, I have a question.”
        “Yeah?”
        “What would happen if I said that my mother and I had the same dream?”
        “WHAAAAAAAAAT!!!??? You better get out of there as soon as possible, and I mean moving away from here in at most 90 days. 
        Do you even know what you’re saying!?”
        “Yes! I do! We both have the same nightmares about the lord of the dark.”  
        “OMG, then you should get out of there in less than a month!!! And make sure you tell your parents about this as well. 
        I might as well also move in case it might happen to me.”
        “Ok how far do I have to move away from here in this case?”
        “About 100-120 miles away.”
        “Woah, I don’t really think that might be possible by my parents to happen in less than a month.”
        “It’s the only way possible if you don’t want to get killed. Wait..do you want to be killed?”
        “Christina!!!”
        “Sorry, just asking!”
        “Charlotte! Are you sharing this matter with your friends,” Mom interrupted.
        “Sorry, I never got that many things out of you! I was very curious and did not want to make you very mad,” I explained.
        “I was trying to help,” Christina said over the phone, “Mrs. Loren. Please let me help. Pleeeease? ”
        It was a very silent moment until Mom agreed. Now, Christina said bye and cut the call before I could say the same to her.

         Anyways, we went to eat lunch, as the time was going to be noon. We had Enchiladas without chicken. We were planning to go
          to the local zoo after getting done with our food. So, I went to my room to change. I wore my usual dress just like I always 
          do. It was a pink T-shirt with a purple frock. I went to check on my mother to see if she was done, and she was ready before 
          I could go there and I almost ran into her. We went to the garage and zoomed to the zoo. Without Dad.
    ~
    We had to drive for an hour before reaching the zoo. We also had to wait another 15 minutes before we actually got to have the fun. 
    Which totals 1 hour and 15 minutes of waiting time before the real fun of the zoo. I thought we might as well go to the elephant exhibit, 
    but then we thought about going to see marine life first. The most fun part was seeing the octopus eat the fish, although that wasn’t 
    supposed to happen. The octopus was charged a “fine” of one tentacle for eating the fish without consent. (But they don’t need to worry
     about that “fine” because they could regrow their tentacles!) Ok, enough of talking about eating and stuff, we carried on to the place 
     where we felt like we were in a tunnel under the sea. That was supposed to make us feel very amazed.

    We went on to the jungle animals exhibit after that. That was way much more fun, for the reason of us having the chance to take an 
    elephant ride for a mile, although I had felt bad for them for the fact that they might have been doing many rides that day as the amount
     of visitors at the zoo looked more than usual. I don’t really know because I am coming here after a year or two. Anyways, after I got that
      ride done, I started to head for the train ride that would take us around the whole place without us having to walk the whole place and be 
      tired after all that walking.

    We came back home after that exhibit because we were tired and satisfied with all the animals. I wanted to text my friend to have a video chat 
    while my parents ordered Domino’s. I tried doing a video call…

    “Hi, Christina.”
    “Hey! Wassup?”
    She moved around in front of the camera to see that we still haven’t moved yet.
    “You still haven’t moved? Or even started?” Christina observed.
    “I FORGOT!!!”
    “Here, I will call you as soon as you get done moving and all that hoohah. Byee!!!”
    “Christina,” I started, “Wait—”
    But she already cut the call. I got to tell Mom that we have to move or else the dream will come true before we even know it. I ran down the 
    stairs to her room. That might sound weird, but who cares about house floor plans anyway? Dinner was served as I came down and Mom called me 
    over there.

    “Mom!”
    “Yes?”
    “Mom, we’ve got to move out of this place before our nightmares come true!”
    “What?! Moving away?! Ok honey, we aren't moving anywhere.”
    I stared at her for a long time before saying, “But Mom—”
    “The only ‘but’ I want to see is yours eating your dinner,” she scolded, as we got done with dinner as soon as we finished the topic. I set 
    up for the next day as I went to my room. How could Mom not agree with my idea—I mean Christina’s idea—about moving because of how much danger 
    we are in? Is she too tired for the right answer? I continued my setup. There wasn’t school or anything like that, but I put some stuff for me 
    to do if I wake up before my parents do. I turned off the lights, turned on the night light and went to sleep.

   <i> The next day, I woke up to see no bed, no furniture, but just myself tied up in a chair.</i>
