Computers are the one thing that we use in our everyday life. A computer can be defined as the machine that has a 
specific algorhythm that we insert some information into and then, the output will come out as something that you 
will kind of expect, kind of not. We use computers everyday in our lives as i mentioned in the beggining. what types
of computers are there? There are:
<ul>
<li> Supercomputers </li>
<li> PC </li>
li> Desktop </li>
<li> Laptop </li>
<li> Monitor </li>
<li> Gaming Computer </li>
<li> The Altair </li>
<li> TV </li>
li> Gaming Consol </li>
</ul>
Anyways the computer family has one thing in commmon: They all have a way to connect to a different type of server
and they also have a type of algorhythm that makes the computer have a way to tell the output if you hve an input.
The other thing that is common about all the computers that i listed is that all the computers have a Screen or touch
screen related or included in the system. The other thing that makes computers interesting is that the computers always
have a way for you to play some type of gamee or fun thing to do. So, as I was saying, the point of having a computer is
having a lot of reasons, but here I am listing a few:
<ol>
<li> Gaming (My personal favorite) </li>
<li> office/personal work </li>
<li> As a music player you can also use it as a music editor or a music player </li>
<li> To learn something new </li>
<li> To code a useful website or app and make it run </li>
</ol>
There are soooooooooooooooooooooo many ways to use computers. The reason for computers has also come to the point
where anyone can learn about coding and learn anything at anytime to use up their time. For example, there is a coding
website that can also teach you about different ways to code. I am Literally using a coding website to make this one.
The point of this whole article is to help you understand the importance of computers and also learn something new. Well,
if you are intereted in making websites like these, then go to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp"> W3Schools.com </a>, and learn more!!!
